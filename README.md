Project: Landing Page

From The Odin Project, Foundations, Flexbox section.

Used all HTML and CSS learned so far to create a webpage from scratch and structure it through  Flexbox via CSS.

All images sourced from www.pexels.com and wikipedia.org.

A couple issues during development, due to typos that didn't close tags properly on the HTML side.
CSS went by pretty smoothly. Flexbox/flex-item/div container confusion a few times, but figured it out by myself and fixed it quite quickly.
